1.	How do I approach designing software?
o	What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
This course taught me a lot of new design skills. It can be difficult to take a 2D image and try to recreate it in 3D through code. Application of textures, shaders, and lighting helped produce the most realistic rendering of the original scene.
o	What design process did you follow for your project work?
The goal was to recreate the most accurate 3D representation of the original image. The course was a great guide in helping achieve this. Each week we learned something new which we applied to our final project.
o	How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
This course has taught me how valuable it can be to break things down and work on them one at a time to achieve the best finish product.

2.	How do I approach developing programs?
o	What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
One strategy I learned in this course is the value of mastering one task at a time. This help with the final project as there were not many fine tweaks I had to make before the final submission. 
o	How did iteration factor into your development?
It played a big role as previously mentioned working one thing at a time and applying it individually helped in obtaining the best recreation of the original scene. 
o	How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
It was impressive to see how my scene change from week 3 to the final project. Each week the project became more and more like the original image.

3.	How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
o	How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
One thing I enjoy in my spare time is video games and I found myself during this course finding more enjoyment and appreciation of the work the developers of these games have put. Everything from the textures and the lighting is so important to the overall user experience. Having the possibility to do something like this for my future career would be incredible.
o	How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
The structure of the code in this course has taught me the value of clean and reusable code. I found myself coding in a way that if I had to in the future I could easily go back and add or adjust. This is something I could use in my future and that is not just with computational graphs but software development as a whole.
